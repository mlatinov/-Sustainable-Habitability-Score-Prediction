# 🏡 Sustainable Habitability Score Prediction

Can AI help find the perfect home? This project aims to predict a property's Sustainable Habitability Score using machine learning techniques. By analyzing property details, we can provide data-driven insights to help individuals make more informed housing decisions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This challenge is part of the #MLOlympiad and is inspired by the Kaggle Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 14 competition. The goal is to develop an interpretable ML model that predicts how habitable a property is based on available features.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains property information from across the United States, featuring attributes such as:

- 🏠 Property Type & Size

- 🌍 Location & Neighborhood Features

- 💡 Amenities & Infrastructure

- ♻️ Sustainability Factors

- 🏗️ Building Condition 

## 🎯 Key Objectives

✅ Build an ML model to predict habitability scores.

✅ Focus on explainability—help users understand what drives the score.

✅ Improve decision-making for sustainable and comfortable living.
